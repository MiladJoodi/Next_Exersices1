If you want to be a professional developer, you have to know the fundamentals like JavaScript and CSS really well. I highly recommend you go through my [Professional JavaScript](https://bytegrad.com/courses/professional-javascript) and [Professional CSS](https://bytegrad.com/courses/professional-css) courses.

I'm close to releasing a complete React & Next.js course. Get on the email list to receive early-bird pricing: [link](https://email.bytegrad.com/).
